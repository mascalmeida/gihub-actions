# GitHub Actions & Terraform

Throught [the Data Engineer Cloud bootcamp](https://github.com/mascalmeida/bootcamp-xpe-data-eng-cloud) I have learned about a lot of fundamental Data Engineering tools, but what I liked the most was Terraform and the IaC concept (Infrastructure as a Code). For developers like me that love best practices and guidelines on development workflow, Terraform is a vital friend hahaha

Using the HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) is possible to create the cloud resource infrastructure as codes, therefore, making the deployment task easy and guaranteeing that the company rules are followed.

To consolidate my knowledge I created this GitHub repository. Using GitHub actions combine to Terraform I created a complete deployment workflow for an Amazon S3 bucket.
